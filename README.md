# Migration-Error
A backend problem i had once faced recently
Migrating : A Database Query Error

I was working on a new feature for my application using django, it involved storing additional user data. The data model was updated, and i changed a field in the model. However, when I attempted to run the migration, I encountered a error message; django.db.migrations.exceptions.InconsistentMigrationHistory, django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table

Step 1: Understanding the Error Message
Django migrations rely on your models to define the database schema. If you make changes to your database tables directly (outside of migrations) or forget to update your models to reflect changes in data structure, migrations might fail.
When creating migrations, ensure data types and constraints defined in your models are compatible with your database engine

Step 2: Examining the Migration File
Next, I reviewed the migration file itself. It looped through existing users and inserted their data into the new table. Everything seemed fine on the surface, but there could have been a subtle bug or a missing check.

Step 3: Fixing the Migration and Preventing Future Issues
After making some research and also with the aid of the django documentation, i was able to find two solutions
We can reverse  migrations and then re-run the whole migration process i.e python manage.py migrate model zero
Python manage.py makemigrations
Python manage.py migrate
If you want to restart from scratch with an empty database. You should also remove the django_migrations table. By removing the table, you only cancelled what correspond to your 0001_initial migration, just remove the corresponding record in django_migrations table
Step 6: I tested the modified migration


This was one of the most challenging yet exciting backend problem I have encountered, i aim to further improve my skills on my HNG journey.
